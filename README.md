# 6.824-cljlabs-2020

This is a Clojure translation of the Go code for the labs of the Spring 2020 offering of MIT's [6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/), taught by Prof. Robert Morris. You can read more about how I implemented Lab 2 in my blog post on [Raft in Clojure](https://phillippe.siclait.com/blog/raft-in-clojure).

Translation progress:

- [x] [Lab 1](map-reduce)
- [x] [Lab 2](raft)
- [ ] Lab 3
- [ ] Lab 4

## Tests

Run the tests for each lab by executing

```shell
$ make test
```

in the appropriate folder.
